# PyCipher
### By PineappleFan

PyCipher allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages based on an array structure

### Explanation

Ciphers are stored as an array, for example:

```
A B C
D E F
G H I
```

This program gives functions such as rotation/flipping. For example, if you rotate the cipher 90 degrees, it would look like this:

```
G D A
H E B
I F C
```

Some ciphers also require a string (polybius, for example). When used, the user is prompted for a string.
